**overview**
This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques. 
By analyzing historical movie data, the model developed here provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows for accurate rating estimations.
**Project Description**
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the rating of a movie. 
The model leverages various features such as the movie's genre, director, and main actors.
By exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques, this project provides valuable insights into movie rating predictions.
**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is an IMDb movies dataset, which includes information on movie Name, Genre, Director, Actor 1, and Votes.
**Usage**
Ensure the dataset IMDb Movies India.csv is placed in the project directory.
**Model Evaluation**
The script evaluates the model using several regression metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between estimated and actual values.
R-squared (RÂ²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
